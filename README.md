# The Connect Four Game!

I've played this game a lot growing up and I am very happy to be able to recreate this game here!

### Rules:
- Player 1 is red and Player 2 is blue
- Each player will take turns putting their piece on the board to get 4 connected pieces
- To put the pieces on the board, place them from the top
